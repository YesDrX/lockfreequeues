# lockfreequeues

Lock-free queues for Nim, implemented as ring buffers.

Three implementations are provided:

- [`Sipsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/sipsic.html) is a single-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Pushing and popping are wait-free.
- [`Mupsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupsic.html) is a multi-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Popping is wait-free.
- [`Mupmuc`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupmuc.html) is a multi-producer, multi-consumer bounded queue.

API documentation: https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues

Note: if your project is compiled with `--threads:off`, only `Sipsic` is available.

## Installation

```sh
nimble install lockfreequeues
```

## Examples

Examples are located in the [examples](https://github.com/elijahr/lockfreequeues/tree/master/examples) directory and can be compiled and run with:

```sh
nimble examples
```

## Running tests

Tests can be run locally with `nimble test`.

CI runs the test suite for both C and C++ targets on Linux (`x86_64`, `armv7`, `aarch64`, `ppc64le`) and macOS (`x86_64`).

Nightly builds look for and test against the latest release of Nim.
