# lockfreequeues

Lock-free queues for Nim, implemented as ring buffers.

Three implementations are provided:

- [`Sipsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/sipsic.html) is a single-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Pushing and popping are wait-free.
- [`Mupsic`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupsic.html) is a multi-producer, single-consumer bounded queue. Popping is wait-free. Compile with `--threads:on`.
- [`Mupmuc`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupmuc.html) is a multi-producer, multi-consumer bounded queue. Compile with `--threads:on`.
