# lockfreequeues

Lock-free queue (aka ring buffer) implementations for Nim.

Four implementations are provided:

- [`SipsicStaticQueue`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/sipsic_static_queue.html) is a single-producer, single-consumer queue for when your queue's capacity is known at compile-time.
- [`SipsicSharedQueue`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/sipsic_shared_queue.html) is a single-producer, single-consumer queue for when your queue's capacity is only known at run-time, or when the queue should reside in shared memory.
- [`MupsicStaticQueue`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupsic_static_queue.html) is a multi-producer, single-consumer queue for when your queue's capacity and number of producers are known at compile-time.
- [`MupsicSharedQueue`](https://elijahr.github.io/lockfreequeues/lockfreequeues/mupsic_shared_queue.html) is a multi-producer, single-consumer queue for when your queue's capacity or number of producers are only known at run-time, or when the queue should reside in shared memory.

## Release notes

## v2.0.0 - 2020-07-29

* Refactor, rename SPSC to Sipsic; it's much easier for my eyes and brain.
* Implement multi-producer, single-consumer (Mupsic) queues.

## v1.0.0 - 2020-07-6

* Addresses feedback from [#1](https://github.com/elijahr/lockfreequeues/issues/1)
* `head` and `tail` are now in the range `0 ..<2*capacity`
* `capacity` doesnâ€™t have to be a power of two
* Use `align` pragma instead of padding array

## v0.1.0 - 2020-07-02

Initial release, containing `SipsicSharedQueue` and `SipsicStaticQueue`.
